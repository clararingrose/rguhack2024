<h2>Wooden Figures</h2>
<p>
    These wood carvings were 
    originally situated in the park 
    specifically for children to 
    play on. They were carved by 
    students of Aberdeen Grayâ€™s 
    School of Art in Garthdee, 
    who were employed by the 
    Parks Department during the 
    summers of 1971, 1972, 
    and 1973</p>
