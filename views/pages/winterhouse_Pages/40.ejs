<h2>Stained Glass Windows</h2>
<p>
    These are the original windows from the public toilets on the 
    lower Promenade near the Beach Ballroom. To mark their Golden 
    Jubilee in 1971, the Soroptimist International Society paid for their 
    restoration. Two windows hang together and the third is by the caf√©.</p>
